enumerations are a specific subset of possible values. you can create it within or outside the class. how you could use a enum for directions enum Direction {North, East, South, West};
you can have the directions equal any value such as north = 1 and so on. the constants can be changed to any type.
the variable can have a myDirection.North can equal anything and you can return reverse direction so it would return the oppisate direction
so north equals south, and south would equal north, west would equal east and east would equal west.
